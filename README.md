### Merge Sorting
In merge_sort.py is a merge sorting function to sort arrays.
Recursive sorting by divide and conquer splitting the the array into smaller arrays and then merging them again.
Best for larger array size or datasets.
Merge Sort is quite fast, and has a time complexity of O(n*log n). It is also a stable sort, which means the "equal" elements are ordered in the same order in the sorted list. (https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/merge-sort)
