### Merge Sorting
In merge_sort.py is a merge sorting function to sort arrays.  
Recursive sorting by divide and conquer splitting the the array into smaller arrays and then merging them again.  
Best for larger array size or datasets.  
Merge Sort is quite fast, and has a time complexity of O(n*log n). It is also a stable sort, which means the "equal" elements are ordered in the same order in the sorted list. (https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/merge-sort)

### Linked List
A linked list is a data structure which can change during execution.
* Successive elements are connected by pointers.
* Last element points to None.
* It can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program.
* It can be made just as long as required.
* It does not waste memory space.

Linked lists are suitable for:
* Inserting an element.
* Deleting an element.
* Applications where sequential access is required.
* In situations where the number of elements cannot be predicted beforehand.
